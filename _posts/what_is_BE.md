Behavioral Economics or behavioral sciences in general is becoming more and more popular within organisation and governmental organisations (often called nudge units or behavioral insights units).

What is behavioral economics or science?

·      Behavioral economics is a multi-disciplinary subject intersecting between economics and psychology.

·      Behavioral science is a much broader area, it includes insights from sociology, psychology, neuroscience, economics, etc.

·       Essentially, ‘behavioral studies’ aims to understand human behavior and explain why we do what we do.

·      This understanding is then used to change/ better human decision making or organisational operations.
What is a nudge?

Popularized by renowned authors Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, “A nudge, as we will use the term, is any aspect of the choice architecture that alters people’s behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives.”

Why is it important?

·      Employee: No matter the industry, it comprises of people, people from diverse cultures and personalities. Understanding employees – what motivates them to work in the interest of the organisation and then bringing about that change is extremely valuable to build a stable and successful business.

·      Customers: Deliver to your customer’s best interest through knowledge of their intrinsic and extrinsic needs.

·      Better decision making: Bring about change and help maintain it through research and experiments.
